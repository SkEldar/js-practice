TOPIC PROS AND CONS OF ONLINE COMMUNICATION

Hello, my name is Eldar and today I would like to talk with you about communication on the Internet.

At the moment, the network is used by more than 4.54 billion people and each of them at least once communicated on the Internet with his family, friend or acquaintance.
For this, people use social networks.

Let's all find out the pros and cons of online communication.
Perhaps what is a big plus is that the network gives us the opportunity to communicate with people regardless of where we are, let's say I am in Kazakhstan and my English teacher is in the USA and I need to send him a message that I have finished the mask, the first thing that comes on my mind it is, of course, to send a message in whatsapp or e-mail, which in fact I do.

There is also a big plus to communicate by video call, which allows you to see other countries without leaving your home
Let's move on to the disadvantages of online communication,
This, of course, is that there are no emotions on the network, that is, a person can read certain words in the wrong tone, which may lead to a conflict.
I would also like to note that people are addicted to surf the Internet and communicate with people, which entails harm to health, namely eyes and posture.

At the moment, online communication greatly affects our life and I can say with confidence that for teenagers, online communication takes 60% of our time, I hope that in the future everything will change and we will be able to communicate online without drawbacks, but what do you think?
